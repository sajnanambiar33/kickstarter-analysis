# Campaign analysis based on launch date and goal


## Overview of Project
    View the outcome of different campaigns based on the launch date and the goals achieved to see the trends in campaigns. The outcome of campaigns released over the years according to the launch date and goals were analyzed using different criteria and represented using charts and tables to help predict the possible outcomes in future.
## Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
* Categories were separated 
* Year Extracted from the launch date using  YEAR()
* Pivot table created using the data 
* Pivot table analyzed to see the trends in data according to the launch date.
* Pivot chart created using the combed data from the pivot table. 

Line chart is created using the data from the table. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
   New columns are created in a new sheet for goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* The formula used for time conversion was too long and complex. 
* A possible challenge could be labelling the axes with the correct criteria, so the data is easily readable.

## Results
 - What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Number of theatre campaigns launched and successful were the highest for the month of May over the years, followed by the month of June. Number of theatre campaigns launched and successful were the lowest for the month of December followed by the month of November.
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   Number of successful campaigns launched were in the data range of $ 1000 to $ 5000 followed by the data range of $ 5000 to $ 10000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
 This data is inconclusive to compare the launch date and goal range to find the outcome.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A funnel chart or a clustered column would be a good representation of this data.
